# Tailwind Mail Reports

Rather than have a big frontend app with ad-hoc reports, I think we should kick up our very own reporting thing using somethign like [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com) which [runs on Docker](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operation/running-metabase-on-docker) and I think we can probably seed it with some fun reports.
